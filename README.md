# CS130-W1-Word-Search
An example code project for students to practice reading Python code

Try to read the code in word_search.py. As you read through the code listing, make notes about each line or sets of lines. For this exercise, you should make your best guess about how the program will execute.
Once you have read through and predicted how the code functions, feel free to download the code and the accompanying text file (words_alpha.txt) so that you can run the code locally. For the code to run properly, note that the text file and the Python file must be in the same folder on your local machine.
Have fun!
